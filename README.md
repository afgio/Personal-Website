# Personal Website

My responsive personal website is largely designed using Bootstrap's customizable classes. It includes a wide range of advanced components such as Scrollspy, Tooltips, Modals, and Cards. Additionally, I use several plugins such as [TypeIt's](https://www.typeitjs.com/) typewriter effect and [EmailJS](https://www.emailjs.com/) as an email service.
